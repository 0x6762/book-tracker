    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> <span id="effective-date">September 30, 2025</span></p>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Book Tracker</strong> ("the App") by
      <strong>Readr</strong> handles your information. We designed the App to work primarily
      offline and to store your data <strong>locally on your device</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Library data you add</strong> (e.g., book titles, authors, reading status,
        notes, ratings) is stored locally on your device using a local database.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Usage data</strong>: The App does not collect analytics or tracking data by default.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Account data</strong>: The App does not require an account or login.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>
      Your library data is used solely to provide App functionality (e.g., tracking your
      reading progress). We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Your data is stored locally on your device.</li>
      <li>
        If you uninstall the App or clear its data, the locally stored data may be removed.
      </li>
      <li>
        We recommend maintaining your own backups if you wish to preserve your data when
        switching devices.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Notifications</strong> (optional): Used to remind you about reading goals or
        updates you explicitly enable. Notifications can be disabled at any time in system
        settings.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The App is not directed to children under the age of 13. If you believe a child has
      provided personal information, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      The App does not integrate third-party analytics or advertising SDKs. If future
      versions add integrations, we will update this policy and clearly disclose how data
      is used.
    </p>

    <h2>International Users</h2>
    <p>
      The App is designed to store data locally on your device, and data is not routinely
      transferred outside your device.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Material changes will be noted by
      updating the “Effective date” above. Continued use of the App after changes means you
      accept the updated policy.
    </p>
